export const ProprietorshipAboutText = [
  `Proprietorship is an alias for the Proprietor to do business. Proprietorships are ideal for very small businesses in 
    the unorganised sector. A sole proprietorship is a type of unregistered business entity that is owned, managed and 
    controlled by one person. Sole proprietorship’s are one of the most common forms of business in India, used by most 
    micro and small businesses operating in the unorganised sectors. Proprietorships are very easy to start and have very 
    minimal regulatory compliance requirement for started and operating. However, after the startup phase, proprietorship’s 
    do not offer the promoter a host of benefits such as limited liability proprietorship, corporate status, separate legal 
    entity, independent existence, transferability, perpetual existence – which are desirable features for any business. 
    Therefore, proprietorship registration is suited only for unorganised, small businesses that will remain small and/or 
    have a limited period of existence.There is no mechanism provided by the Government of India for the registration of a 
    Proprietorship. Therefore, the existence of a proprietorship must be established through tax registrations and other 
    business registrations that a business is required to have as per the rules and regulations. For instance, VAT or Service 
    Tax or GST Registration can be obtained in the name of the Proprietor to establish that the Proprietor is operating a 
    business as a sole proprietorship. Thus, all the registrations for a proprietorship would be in the name of the Proprietor, 
    making the Proprietor personally liable for all the liabilities of the Proprietorship.Purminder Kaur & Associates is the market 
    leader in company registration services in India, offering a variety of company registration like private limited company

  entrepreneurs who on their own are capable of starting a venture by allowing them to create a single person economic entity.
   One of the biggest advantages of a One Person Company (OPC) is that there can be only one member in a OPC, while a minimum of 
   two members are required for incorporating and maintaining a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). 
   Similar to a Company, a One Person Company is a separate legal entity from its promoter, offering limited liability protection 
   to its sole shareholder, while having continuity of business and being easy to incorporate.Though a One Person Company allows a 
   lone Entrepreneur to operate a corporate entity with limited liability protection, a OPC does have a few limitations. For instance, 
   every One Person Company (OPC) must nominate a nominee Director in the MOA and AOA of the company – who will become the owner of 
   the OPC in case the sole Director is disabled. Also, a One Person Company must be converted into a Private Limited Company if it 
   crosses an annual turnover of Rs.2 crores and must file audited financial statements with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs at the 
   end of each Financial Year like all types of Companies. Therefore, it is important for the Entrepreneur to carefully consider the

  `Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) offer limited liability protection for an association of persons doing business. 
  LLP is ideal for small businesses.Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) was introduced in India by way of the Limited Liability 
  Partnership Act, 2008. The basic premise behind the introduction of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is to provide a 
  form of business entity that is simple to maintain while providing limited liability to the owners. Since, its introduction 
  in 2010, LLPs have been well received with over 1 lakhs registrations so far until September, 2014.The main advantage of a 
  Limited Liability Partnership over a traditional partnership firm is that in a LLP, one partner is not responsible or liable 
  for another partner’s misconduct or negligence. A LLP also provides limited liability protection for the owners from the debts 
  of the LLP. Therefore, all partners in a LLP enjoy a form of limited liability protection for each individual’s protection within 
  the partnership, similar to that of the shareholders of a private limited company. However, unlike private limited company 
  shareholder, the partners of a LLP have the right to manage the business directly.LLP is one of the easiest form of business to 
  incorporate and manage in India. With an easy incorporation process and simple compliance formalities, LLP is preferred by 
  Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family owned or closely-held. Since, LLPs are not capable of issuing equity 
  shares, LLP should be used for any business that has plans for raising equity funds during its lifecycle.Purminder Kaur & Associates

    The shares of a company can be transferred from one person to another by executing a share transfer deed.The ownership of a 
    company limited by shares is held by the shareholders of the Company. The shareholders in turn appoint Directors to manage 
    the affairs of the Company. Hence, ownership of a company rests with the shareholders and not the Directors. Transfer of 
    ownership of a company can therefore be accomplished by transferring shares of the company from one person or entity to 
    another. Share transfer in a private limited company is usually more restricted when compared to a listed company that 
    is publicly traded. The entire shares of a private limited company are usually owned by a family or a small group of 
    persons or entities. Hence, most of the Articles of Association of a Private Limited Company limit the right of a
    shareholder to transfer the company’s shares to an outsider. Therefore, it is important to review the Articles of
